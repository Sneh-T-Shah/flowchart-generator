Based on the provided README file and directory structure, I'll provide the required information:

### Main Function of the Project and Project Working

The main function of the Medi-Clarity project is to bridge the gap between medical professionals and patients by making medical prescriptions and reports more accessible and understandable. The project uses advanced AI technology, specifically OpenAI's GPT-4, to transform complex medical documents into clear, patient-friendly explanations.

The project working can be summarized as follows:

1. Users upload medical prescriptions or reports to the application.
2. The application uses AI to process the uploaded documents and generate detailed explanations.
3. The explanations are then provided to the users, making it easier for them to understand their medical documents.

### Flow of Data in the Project

The flow of data in the project can be summarized as follows:

1. **User Input**: Users upload medical prescriptions or reports to the application.
2. **AI Processing**: The uploaded documents are processed using OpenAI's GPT-4 API to generate detailed explanations.
3. **Explanation Generation**: The AI generates detailed explanations of the uploaded medical documents.
4. **Output**: The explanations are provided to the users, making it easier for them to understand their medical documents.

### Database Schema

There is no explicit database schema mentioned in the provided README file or directory structure. However, it can be inferred that the application may use a database to store user data, uploaded documents, and generated explanations.

A possible database schema could include the following tables:

* **Users**: stores user information, such as username, password, and email.
* **Documents**: stores uploaded medical prescriptions or reports, including the document type, upload date, and user ID.
* **Explanations**: stores generated explanations, including the explanation text, document ID, and user ID.

### Step-by-Step Working of the Project

Here is a step-by-step flowchart of the project:

1. **User Uploads Document**:
	* User selects a medical prescription or report to upload.
	* User clicks the upload button.
2. **Document Upload**:
	* The uploaded document is stored in the **Documents** table.
	* The document is processed using OpenAI's GPT-4 API.
3. **AI Processing**:
	* The AI processes the uploaded document to generate a detailed explanation.
	* The explanation is stored in the **Explanations** table.
4. **Explanation Generation**:
	* The AI generates a detailed explanation of the uploaded medical document.
	* The explanation is provided to the user.
5. **User Receives Explanation**:
	* The user receives the generated explanation.
	* The user can view and understand their medical document.

Here is a simple flowchart representing the above steps:
